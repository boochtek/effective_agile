What Is Agile?
==============

You've probably heard the term "Agile"
but might not have a very good idea what it really means.
That's OK --- the word is often overused and abused.

Agile Practices
---------------

From the Agile values and principles, we have many practices.
A practice is like a framework or template for a set of processes.
Each team will adapt the practice to create their own processes.

Some examples of Agile practices:

* Pair programming
* Retrospectives
* TODO: more (including some that we're not necessarily covering)


Agile Methodologies
-------------------

There are many "flavors" of Agile.
These are often called *methodologies*.
A methodology is a set of practices,
possibly with an accompanying set of values and principles.
