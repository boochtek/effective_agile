Dave Thomas from This Agile Life
================================

* Need to get Dave Thomas' TAL podcast transcribed, and make sure we
incorporate most of his ideas.

* Agile is *in some ways* a set of advanced techniques.
  * At least Dave Thomas seems to think so.
  * But everyone can find some benefits.
  * A good team will always have a better chance of succeeding than an
    average team, no matter what the methodology.

* Make a small change.
  * Lean toward changes that will lead to more flexibility in the future.

* There is no magic bullet.
  * But we've found these practices to help in most cases.


Diagrams
========

* Time/cost versus scope as constraints.
  * Slide 10 - http://www.slideshare.net/dimka5/introducing-agile-scrum-xp-and-kanban
* Iterative nature (concentric loops).
* Kanban boards.


Other
=====

* People are not "resources".
  * If the worker bees are called "resources", then the managers should
    be called "overhead". (Amos)

* Lots of good stuff in that Agile Product Owner video.

* Theory Y versus Theory X.

* Agile can't make up for bad developers.
  * Good developers can partially make up for bad methodologies.
  * Agile can help encourage developers to become better.


Kanban
======

* Basic tenets:
  * Visualization
  * Flow (pull)
  * Limiting WIP


Estimation
==========

* "There is a geometric relationship between the length of an estimate and its inaccuracy."
  * http://mikehadlow.blogspot.co.uk/2014/03/coconut-headphones-why-agile-has-failed.html
* "Hard deadlines, especially micro-deadlines will result in poor quality software that will take longer to deliver."

Bad Agile
=========

* Coaches who add/do very little:
  * http://www.agilecoach.co.uk/Articles/DoAllDay.html
  * Go with Agile practitioners instead.
    * They will "do" Agile with you, showing you by doing actual work on your product.
    * More of a player/coach.
    * They need to have experience "in the trenches".


Ideas from Andy Hunt
====================

* We need to counteract a lot of biases that we have: https://pragprog.com/magazines/2011-01/guru-meditation
  * These biases basically create inertia to keep doing what we're already doing.
    * Even if what we're doing is counter-productive.
