with and easier to change. A low-quality code base is full of bugs and is
very hard to change without breaking things.

This is usually due to people not "buying into" the whole idea.
And every failure makes people think that Agile is bad.
But Agile is just a tool.
And like most tools, it works a lot better if you know how to use it.


A Leap of Faith
---------------

Adopting Agile requires a leap of faith.
It's hard to believe that these 

Usually this comes from one of two places.
