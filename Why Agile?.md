Why Agile?
==========


Quality
-------

The number one reason to use Agile principles and practices is to build a
better product.

The interesting thing about focusing on quality is that it might appear to
reduce productivity in the short term, but it almost always improves
productivity in the long run. A high-quality code base is easier to work
with and easier to change. A low-quality code base is full of bugs and is
very hard to change without breaking things.

Feedback

TODO: Building what the customer needs, instead of what they asked for.


What We've Found To Work
------------------------

We're advocates for Agile, because we've found it to work well.
The techniques and practices in this book are things that we've found in
our experience to work in most situations.

The advice in this book is prescriptive only because we've found that
people need prescriptive advice on where to start. The whole idea of Agile
is to be adaptable. So we encourage you to change your practices over
time, as you learn more about what works for your team and your situation.
